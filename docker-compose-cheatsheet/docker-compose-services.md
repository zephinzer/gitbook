  This page provides YAML configurations for services I often use via a Docker
  Compose file usually as part of bringing up a development enviornment.

# üçÇ Docker Compose Services

## Overview

Some overarching rules for the following manifests are:

1. All usernames will be `user` unless setting it as such is impossible
2. All passwords will be `password` unless setting it as such is impossible
3. Persistence for data is enabled by default will be on local disk at a directory `./data` and will follow the image's recommended configuration path
4. Configuration for services is done via environment variables as far as possible
5. Configuraton for services which have to be via file will be on local disk at a directory `./config/%SERVICE_NAME%/*`
6. Ports will always be forwarded from container to host AS-IS, this means if you have another instance of the same service running locally, the port will fail to listen on the host network. Configure as needed
