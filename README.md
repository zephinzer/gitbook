# Hello

Welcome to my digital garden hosted on Gitbook. I never know what to say here so... Have fun and good luck I guess!

> I chose Gitbook because it allows me an integration which no other providers enable: Git. Since I'm a software creator, I'd like to be able to update my documents in the same way I do my life's work - in code. This may not suit you and you can find out more about setting up your own digital garden from this webpage - [How to set up your own digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up)
