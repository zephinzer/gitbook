# Speech Acts

The Speech Acts are categories of language which we use in day-to-day life whether we notice it or not. Noticing these enables us to be more intentional with our communication and heighten our chances of getting what we want in conversations with others.

## Assertions

* Factual according to widely acknowledged truths
* Can be either true or false and nothing more
* Examples
  * That is a table
  * This is a laptop
  * She walked over to me
  * She had a frown on her face

## Assessments

* Better known as opinions
* Always valid to the person giving the assessment
* Neither true nor false, only grounded or ungrounded
* Is a reflection of the assessor's observer more than the thing being observed
* Examples
  * That's a nice table
  * This is a good laptop
  * She was angry with me
  * It has been a bad day

## Requests

* A statement where something is asked for that benefits the speaker
* Frustration is commonly a consequence of an unvocalised request
* In Language and the Pursuit of Happiness, a Request communicates a future that the speaker envisions and wants to move closer towards
  * Saying yes to a speaker: "the future you want to see will happen"
  * Saying no to a speaker: "the future you want to see will not happen"
* Heuristics of a request
  * Clearly identified speaker (who is asking?)
  * Clearly identified listener (who is being asked for something?)
  * Conditions of satisfaction (what needs to be done by the listener?)
  * Time of fulfilment (by when does this need to be done?)
  * Articulation of "for the sake of what" (why does this need to be done?)
  * Resources (does requestee have what they need?)
  * Committed listener (is the listener receptive?)
  * Disposition of speaker
  * Shared background of obviousness
* Constructive outcomes of a request
  * Yes (I'll do it)
  * No (I won't do it)
  * Commit-to-commit (I'll let you know tomorrow)
* Examples
  * Could you help me to take the water bottle?
  * Can you pass me the papers?
  * Can you clear the trash?

## Offers

* A statement where something is offered that benefits the listener
* Similar to requests except the listener tends to benefit
* Examples
  * I could do the schedule for you?
  * I could teach you how to coach others?

## Declarations

* A statement where the speaker declares something is true/false for what they have acknowledged authority over
  * C-level executives: company
  * Parent: family
  * Individual: our own lives
* In Language and the Pursuit of Happiness, a Declaration is argued for as creating a new reality by speaking it into existence
* Declarations communicate a current situation or a vision of a future that does not yet exist
* Examples
  * "We shall aim for 200% growth this year"
  * "I declare the Olympic Games open"
  * Eating very little is not helping me lose weight in the long term
  * Being feisty is not constructive for building working relationships
  * My colleagues don't hate me

## Promises

* A commitment from the speaker to the listener for future action to be taken
* A response to a request or a declaration by a speaker
* Examples
  * Yes
  * No
  * I will go to the gym with you
