## Version Control Systems \(VCS\)

Version control systems are simply software that allows you to "save" your code by providing a label to the state of that code in that moment in time. That label is commonly a hash.

The only realistic option if you're starting a project post-2010 is [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Other systems that existed and were in use include:

* [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)
* [Subversion \(SVN\)](https://subversion.apache.org/)

## Code Hosting Services

Code hosting services provide a place for your verison-controlled source code to stay. You could use Google Drive or Dropbox but they don't provide native integrations with VCSes like Git \(just don't store your code like that\)

As of 2021, these are the most popular/still actively maintained code hosting services:

* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Gitea](https://gitea.io/)
* [Gogs](https://gogs.io/)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
* [Gitbucket](https://gitbucket.github.io/)
